0xA5min: Specter, you online?

[02:31]
Specter: Always. What’s the urgency, 0xA5min?

[02:32]
0xA5min: I need intel on Project Specter. Something big is going down, and ShadowGhost is involved.

[02:33]
Specter: Interesting. Project Specter is top-secret. Even the name is restricted. How did you find out?

[02:34]
0xA5min: ByteCrusher. He was coerced by ShadowGhost and The Reaper. They’re looking for something specific in those files.

[02:35]
Specter: Damn. Alright, I’ll see what I can dig up. Give me a few minutes.

[02:40]
Specter: Got it. Project Specter is an old NetWatch initiative aimed at developing an AI capable of penetrating any cyber defense. Extremely powerful, highly classified.

[02:41]
0xA5min: That's bad. If ShadowGhost gets his hands on it...

[02:42]
Specter: He could control everything. NetWatch, corporations, even city infrastructure. Total domination.

[02:43]
0xA5min: We need to stop him. Any idea where the core files are stored?

[02:44]
Specter: Deep in NetWatch's vault. Physical access required. Nearly impossible to breach without inside help.

[02:45]
0xA5min: Looks like we're going in. Any chance you can help with schematics or insider contacts?

[02:46]
Specter: I can get you schematics. Contacts might take time, but I’ll work on it. You planning a direct assault?

[02:47]
0xA5min: More like a surgical strike. We need to be in and out before they know what hit them.

[02:48]
Specter: Understood. I’ll send over everything I can find. Watch your back, 0xA5min. This is high-stakes.

[02:49]
0xA5min: I know. Thanks, Specter. We’ll stop him. We have to.

[02:50]
Specter: Good luck. Stay safe.

[02:51]
0xA5min: You too. We’re going to need it.
