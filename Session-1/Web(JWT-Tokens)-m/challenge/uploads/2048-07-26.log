0xA5min: Alright team, this is it. Operation Specter is a go. Let’s review our plan one last time.

[03:01]
Specter: I’ve sent over the schematics. The vault is located three levels underground, heavily guarded.

[03:02]
CipherEye: The cyber attack is prepped. Targeting their external monitoring systems. Should create a big enough distraction.

[03:03]
IronClad: I’ve secured transport and escape routes. We’ll have multiple contingencies in place.

[03:04]
RogueWave: Gear and tech are ready. We’ve got breaching tools, EMP devices, and some experimental gear.

[03:05]
ByteCrusher: I’ve verified the access codes. They should get us past the initial security, but we’ll need to move fast.

[03:06]
0xA5min: Excellent. We’ll infiltrate the facility at 0300 sharp. CipherEye, initiate the cyber attack at 0310.

[03:07]
CipherEye: Understood. The attack will begin at 0310. We’ll have about 20 minutes before they start figuring out it’s a diversion.

[03:08]
IronClad: That’s our window. We need to be in and out within 20 minutes. No room for error.

[03:09]
RogueWave: We’ve got this. Stick to the plan, and we’ll be fine.

[03:10]
0xA5min: ByteCrusher, you and I will handle the vault. IronClad, you’re on overwatch. RogueWave, you manage the gear.

[03:11]
ByteCrusher: Got it. I’ll follow your lead, 0xA5min.

[03:12]
IronClad: I’ll keep an eye on security. If anything changes, I’ll alert you immediately.

[03:13]
RogueWave: I’ve got the gear ready. We’re good to go.

[03:14]
Specter: I’ll monitor the network. If anything unusual happens, I’ll let you know.

[03:15]
0xA5min: Alright team, let’s move out. Stay focused, stay sharp.

[03:16]
IronClad: Moving into position.

[03:17]
ByteCrusher: Accessing initial security.

[03:18]
CipherEye: Initiating cyber attack… now.

[03:19]
RogueWave: Gear’s in place. Ready when you are.

[03:20]
0xA5min: We’re in. Moving to the vault.

[03:21]
ByteCrusher: Access codes working. We’re through the first layer.

[03:22]
IronClad: Security is reacting to the attack. We’ve got their attention.

[03:23]
Specter: I’m seeing increased network activity. They’re diverting resources.

[03:24]
0xA5min: Reaching the vault. ByteCrusher, input the secondary codes.

[03:25]
ByteCrusher: On it… codes accepted. We’re in.

[03:26]
RogueWave: Breaching tools ready. EMP primed.

[03:27]
IronClad: Guards moving to intercept. Stay sharp.

[03:28]
0xA5min: Vault door opening… we’re inside.

[03:29]
ByteCrusher: There it is. Project Specter core.

[03:30]
0xA5min: RogueWave, disable security systems. ByteCrusher, secure the core.

[03:31]
RogueWave: Disabling now… systems offline.

[03:32]
ByteCrusher: Core secured. Let’s move.

[03:33]
IronClad: Guards are closing in. We need to move fast.

[03:34]
0xA5min: Exiting the vault. IronClad, cover our escape.

[03:35]
IronClad: Got it. Engaging guards.

[03:36]
RogueWave: Transport is ready. Let’s go.

[03:37]
Specter: They’ve realized it’s a diversion. We need to get out now.

[03:38]
0xA5min: Moving to extraction point. IronClad, fall back.

[03:39]
IronClad: Falling back. Transport in sight.

[03:40]
ByteCrusher: We’re almost there. Keep moving.

[03:41]
RogueWave: Transport secured. Everyone in, now!

[03:42]
0xA5min: We’re in. Get us out of here, RogueWave.

[03:43]
IronClad: We’re clear. Good job, everyone.

[03:44]
Specter: Monitoring shows we’re in the clear. Nice work.

[03:45]
0xA5min: We did it. Project Specter is secure. Let’s debrief and plan our next move.

[03:46]
ByteCrusher: Agreed. We need to decide what to do with the core.

[03:47]
IronClad: This is a huge win, but we’re not out of the woods yet.

[03:48]
RogueWave: Let’s get back and regroup. We’ll figure out our next steps.

[03:49]
Specter: I’ll continue monitoring for any retaliation. Good work, team.

[03:50]
0xA5min: Thanks, everyone. Let’s head back and debrief. We’ve got a lot to discuss.
