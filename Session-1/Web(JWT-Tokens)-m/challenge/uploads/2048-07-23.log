0xA5min: ByteCrusher, are you there?

[00:46]
ByteCrusher: Yeah, I'm here. What's up?

[00:47]
0xA5min: We need to talk about ShadowGhost and what happened. He mentioned you during our last conversation.

[00:48]
ByteCrusher: Shit... I was hoping this wouldn't get out. Look, I didn't have a choice. The Reaper... he found out about my family.

[00:49]
0xA5min: I understand. But we need to find a way to stop them. Did they say anything else to you?

[00:50]
ByteCrusher: They wanted access to some old NetWatch files I had. Said they were looking for something specific.

[00:51]
0xA5min: Did you give it to them?

[00:52]
ByteCrusher: I had to. They were going to hurt my family. I'm sorry, 0xA5min.

[00:53]
0xA5min: It's not your fault. But we need to figure out what they're planning. Any idea what they're after?

[00:54]
ByteCrusher: They mentioned something about Project Specter. I'm not sure what it is, but it seemed important to them.

[00:55]
0xA5min: Project Specter? That sounds familiar. I'll dig into it. In the meantime, stay low and keep your family safe.

[00:56]
ByteCrusher: Will do. And... thanks for understanding.

[00:57]
0xA5min: We're all in this together. We'll find a way to stop them. Stay in touch.

[00:58]
ByteCrusher: I will. Be careful, 0xA5min. Theyâ€™re more dangerous than you think.

[00:59]
0xA5min: I know. But we'll find a way. Talk soon.

[01:00]
ByteCrusher: Talk soon.
