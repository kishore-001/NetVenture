[23:47]
ShadowGhost: Hey, Admin, you there?

[23:48]
0xA5min: Yes, this is 0xA5min. How can I assist you?

[23:49]
ShadowGhost: I need you to reset my account password. Username: D3aDs0ck.

[23:50]
0xA5min: Sure, I can help with that. Please provide your registered email for verification.

[23:51]
ShadowGhost: Let's skip the formalities, Admin. You know what I want.

[23:52]
0xA5min: I'm sorry, but I need the email for security purposes. It's standard procedure.

[23:53]
ShadowGhost: I don't have time for procedures. Give me the and password now, or you'll regret it.

[23:54]
0xA5min: Threats won't get you anywhere. I must follow protocol to keep all users safe.

[23:55]
ShadowGhost: You think I'm joking? I have your dirty little secret. The one about the old NetWatch files.

[23:56]
0xA5min: This is getting serious. I'm alerting the authorities. Don't make this worse for yourself.

[23:57]
ShadowGhost: Go ahead, but it won't change what happens next. 

[23:58]
0xA5min: Please, we can discuss this. There's no need for violence. Just... calm down.

[23:59]
ShadowGhost: Tick-tock, Admin. Last chance.

[00:00]
0xA5min: Alright. Alright. Just give me a moment.

[00:01]
ShadowGhost: That's more like it. Send the ID and password here.

[00:02]
0xA5min: Password: bluM#_M@y_N3vr Don't expose the files.

[00:03]
ShadowGhost: Good choice. And don't even think about changing it. I'll be watching.

[00:04]
0xA5min: You've got it. Just... don't reveal the files. What is the about anyway?

[00:05]
ShadowGhost: As long as you keep your end of the bargain. Later, Admin.

[00:06]
0xA5min: ...

[00:07]
ShadowGhost: By the way, you should thank your colleague, ByteCrusher. They made this so much easier.

[00:08]
0xA5min: ByteCrusher? What did you do to them?

[00:09]
ShadowGhost: Let's just say they had a... convincing chat with our mutual friend, The Reaper. Enjoy your night, Admin.

[00:10]
0xA5min: This isn't over. I'll find a way to stop you.

[00:11]
ShadowGhost: Keep dreaming. In Night City, there's no stopping us. The shadows rule now.

[00:12]
0xA5min: ...

[00:13]
ShadowGhost: Still there, Admin? You must be wondering why I'm doing this.

[00:14]
0xA5min: What's your endgame here? What do you really want?

[00:15]
ShadowGhost: It's simple. Power. Control. The kind that makes even the corpos tremble. And you're going to help me get it.

[00:16]
0xA5min: You're delusional if you think you can control everything. There are forces out there bigger than you.

[00:17]
ShadowGhost: Oh, I know that. But every empire starts with a single step. Tonight, it's your ID and password. Tomorrow, who knows?

[00:18]
0xA5min: You're playing a dangerous game. You won't get away with this.

[00:19]
ShadowGhost: I already have. And there's nothing you can do about it. Your data is mine. Your secrets are mine.

[00:20]
0xA5min: You're making a big mistake. The NetWatch won't ignore this. They'll come for you.

[00:21]
ShadowGhost: NetWatch? Hah. They're just another cog in the machine. Corrupt, easily bought. Just like everyone else in this city.

[00:22]
0xA5min: You're underestimating them. And me. This isn't over. I'll find a way to take you down.

[00:23]
ShadowGhost: Sure, keep telling yourself that. But we both know the truth. You're just another pawn in my game.

[00:24]
0xA5min: If I’m just a pawn, why target me? Why go through all this trouble?

[00:25]
ShadowGhost: Because every king needs his pawns. And tonight, you’ve given me exactly what I needed to become unstoppable.

[00:26]
0xA5min: You’re insane. This power trip will be your downfall.

[00:27]
ShadowGhost: Perhaps. But until then, I’m going to enjoy every moment of it. Oh, and one more thing...

[00:28]
0xA5min: What now?

[00:29]
ShadowGhost: Remember the files. One slip-up, and the whole world will know what you did.

[00:30]
0xA5min: You sick bastard. Leave those files out of this. They have nothing to do with your vendetta.

[00:31]
ShadowGhost: Oh, but they do now. You see, their exposure is contingent on your cooperation.

[00:32]
0xA5min: I’ve given you what you wanted. Isn’t that enough?

[00:33]
ShadowGhost: For now. But if I so much as sense a hint of betrayal, the files go public.

[00:34]
0xA5min: You’re playing with fire. You won’t win.

[00:35]
ShadowGhost: I already have. Night City is mine for the taking. Sweet dreams, Admin.

[00:36]
0xA5min: ...

[00:37]
ShadowGhost: And remember, I’m always watching.

[00:38]
0xA5min: This isn't over. I'll find a way to protect my secrets and stop you.

[00:39]
ShadowGhost: We’ll see about that. Goodnight, 0xA5min.
