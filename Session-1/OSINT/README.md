# Mission Briefing: Operation Shadow Frame

🚨 **Attention, Agent!** 🚨

We've intercepted intel about a rogue operative hiding under the alias **abode45_3**. This individual has uploaded a **top-secret photograph**, and our analysts believe it contains classified information that could compromise national security. However, the key to unlocking this mystery lies in one crucial detail—**the exact date the photo was taken**.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to **track down abode45_3**, retrieve the image, and extract its metadata to determine the timestamp of its origin.

## Flag Format:
```
MAGNUS{DD:MM:YYYY}
```
### Example:
```
MAGNUS{08:12:2023}
```

## Final Directive:
Find the **true date** of the image and submit your findings in the correct flag format. Fail, and the truth remains buried. Succeed, and you crack the code to a hidden conspiracy.

🔎 **Good luck, agent. The clock is ticking...** ⏳
