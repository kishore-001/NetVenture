CipherLoop

Description:

The best tool to crack this custom cipher is your pattern recognition skills! The encryption uses a simple substitution cipher, but key letters appear multiple times, giving you clues to break it.

Your task? Manually analyze the encrypted file and deduce the original flag using frequency analysis and intelligent guessing.

ðŸ›  Hint:
The flag format is magnus{...}. Some letters (m, a, g, n, u, s) appear frequentlyâ€”use them to your advantage!

Can you crack the pattern without breaking your head? ðŸ§ ðŸ’¥
